# An of film Data

**Authors**: Andrew, Cameron, hayden

## Overview

For this project we preformed a simple analysis on a collection of film data obtained primarily from the IMDB website, with some dditional rating data obtained from rotten tomatos and financial data from 'The numbers'. In order to answer our primry question 'How to produce a profitable movie/franchise' we looked at three primary metrics. The first metric was film ratings, and its correlation to a movies genre. Similarly analysis was preformed to determin which genre's tend to be most profitable. In addition we looked into the importance and influence of film directors, as well as the best time of month to release a film.

## Ratings by Genre

In order to look at the rotten tomato ratings data, we created a number of boolean columns coresponding to each of the genres. After cutting down the data to the top 50 and examing it, it became clear that Action-Adventure, Animation, Comedy and Drama were the top preforming genre's by far. As such we narrowed down into those genre's looking at both their their number of movies in the top 50 rated, and their overall distribution.

## Influence of a Film Director

In order to observe a the influence of a film director on movie profits a small sampling of ~1800 films and their monetary information was obtained The Numbers.com, which contains a large film data base. For each film in this sampling IMDB data was used to identify these films directors as well as their stand out works. In order to try and replicate the viewpoint of a consumer, who is unlikely to know  director outside of a few of their most famous works only the ratings of these products were utilized. They were used to preform a regression with the movie profits the results of which are shown below.

As demonstrated by the graph the relation between past ratings and profits is very weak, with only a select group of directors being able to stand out. AS a result it was decided to observe these top directors information in more detail by graph the top 20 most profitable directors and categorizing them by film specializations based on their history in order to try and identify any trends.

From these graphs a few trends are quite interesting. First of all both of top earning directors, Brad Bird and Lee Unkirch, work primarily with animation. Though notably both them and Dan Scanlon, the third animation director in the top 20, work with pixar, which is indicative of the studio quality. Outside of them, there are a lot of action and adventure films, more if you include the likes of Peter Jackson, listed here as sci-fi fantasy, but whose works such as the lord of the rings contain major action and adventure elements. Speaking of the lord of the rings many of the directors here are involved in large series such as marvel directors, indicating the power of familiarty.




## Monetry information

In order to look at manetary statstics the first step was to calculate some useful measures that could be used to compare films. In this case we looked at overall profits, global gross - budget, and rate of return, profits/budget, Narrowing in on some of the top preformers in both there are some interesting results.

In terms of overall profit the top preformers or dominated by either sci-fi films or films that have been adapted from comics or books, for example Harry Potter or Marvel movies. Animation also tends to do fairly well in profits, however rate of return is another story. In rate of return all the top earners are low budget films that preformed well, such as horror films or mad max. This indicates that for smaller budget productions a horror movie will tend to preform better.

In adition to this gnre analysis I also looked at average movie earnings by month to help figure out the best times to release a movie.

Unsuprisingly the summer months preform the best in this category, with may seeing a lot of high preforming marvel releases, while june is similarly dominated by Disney films. The winter months, November and December, also tend to preform well though not quite to the extent as the summer

## Conclusions

Based on our analyis the best way to make a consistently profitable film is to start with a solid work to adapt, something people will recognize and likely get excited for. Preforably this will also feature action and adventure elemets, with the director being either a top preformer such as Joss Whedon or a relatively newer unknown direcotr, to avoid an inflated budget. The best time to release the film is likely to be in july, to avoid direct competion with Marvel or Disney films, while still benfiting from the summer spike. For a smaller one of production horror is the best way to go instead, with their high rate of returns. Directors such as James Wan or David Slade could help out here, though once again may be unnesecary.
